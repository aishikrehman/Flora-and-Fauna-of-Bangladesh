The tree is small to medium-sized, with branchlets covered in adpressed tomentum, sometimes ending in spines. The leaves are simple, oblong-lanceolate, sub-coriaceous, and short-petioled, measuring 14.0 x 2.5 cm. They are three to five-nerved from the base. The inflorescence occurs in axillary cymose clusters. The flowers are bisexual, epigynous, white, and sweet-scented, with a diameter of about 1.5 cm. The calyx consists of 5-10 sepals, connate at the base, forming a cupular tube. The calyx is adnate to the ovary and tomentose, with a triangular-ovate shape. The corolla has 5-10 linear-oblong petals, measuring 2.5 x 0.2 cm. The petals reflex after anthesis, and the disk is prominent. The stamens are usually twice as many as the petals, or more, with filaments measuring 1 cm in length. The base of the filaments is villous and connate, and the anthers measure 1 cm in length, opening by longitudinal slits. The ovary is inferior and unilocular, with a pendulous ovule. The style is long, and the stigma is capitate. The fruit is a 1-seeded berry that is globose and red or black when ripe. The seed is ovoid.
